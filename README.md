# CardioGuardAI: Revolutionizing Cardio-Oncology Diagnostics


## Urgency and Importance

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a global health crisis, and their intersection with cancer treatment presents a significant challenge for cardio-oncologists. **According to the National Library of Medicine, noncommunicable diseases, including CVDs, account for approximately 60% of all deaths worldwide. Specifically, CVDs like ischaemic heart disease and stroke are responsible for 17.7 million deaths, making them the leading cause.** In India, this crisis is particularly acute, with the World Health Organization reporting that the country accounts for one-fifth of global CVD deaths, disproportionately affecting younger populations. The Global Burden of Disease study reveals an age-standardized CVD death rate of 272 per 100,000 in India, significantly higher than the global average of 235.

CardioGuardAI addresses this pressing issue by providing a diagnostic assistant that empowers cardio-oncologists to accurately and efficiently assess the risk of Chemotherapy-Induced Cardiomyopathy (CIC). This is especially crucial in India, where the high volume of patients in government hospitals necessitates rapid and precise diagnostics.

## Problem Statement (Google Girl Hackathon - Ideation Stage)

**Medicine:** A diagnostic assistant, a solution that can analyze medical images, patient data, and symptoms to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases accurately and efficiently (using mock data).

## What CardioGuardAI Does

* **Analyzes Echocardiogram Images:** Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process echocardiogram images and assess the likelihood of CIC.
* **Integrates Patient Data:** Gathers patient information, including age, chemotherapy drugs, dosages, pre-existing conditions (hypertension, diabetes), symptoms, and cancer stage, through an intuitive form.
* **Provides Risk Assessment:** Combines image analysis and patient data to generate a comprehensive risk assessment for CIC.
* **Generates Detailed Reports:** Produces styled PDF reports summarizing the analysis, patient data, and risk assessment.
* **Facilitates Rapid Diagnostics:** Streamlines the diagnostic process, enabling cardio-oncologists to make informed decisions quickly.

## How It Works

1.  **Image Upload:** The user uploads an echocardiogram image.
2.  **Patient Data Input:** The user fills out a form with detailed patient information.
3.  **Image Analysis (CNN):** A pre-trained CNN analyzes the uploaded image to detect potential signs of CIC.
4.  **Data Integration:** The system combines the image analysis results with the patient data.
5.  **Risk Assessment:** A rule-based system (or a more advanced model in future iterations) assesses the risk of CIC based on the integrated data.
6.  **Report Generation:** A styled PDF report is generated and made available for download.

## AI Algorithm Used

* **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
    * Implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.
    * Trained on a dataset of echocardiogram images (mock data for this prototype).
    * Analyzes images by identifying patterns and features associated with CIC.
    * Outputs a probability score indicating the likelihood of CIC.

## Why AI is Needed, Especially in India

* **High Patient Volume:** AI can automate and accelerate the diagnostic process, enabling healthcare professionals to handle a large number of patients efficiently.
* **Expertise Accessibility:** AI can assist in areas where specialized expertise may be limited.
* **Early Detection:** AI can help detect subtle signs of CIC that might be missed by human observation.
* **Standardization:** AI can provide consistent and standardized analysis, reducing variability in diagnoses.

## Similar Apps/Ideas and How CardioGuardAI is Better

While other diagnostic tools exist, CardioGuardAI stands out due to:

* **Integrated Approach:** Combines image analysis and comprehensive patient data for a holistic assessment.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use, enabling quick and efficient data input and analysis.
* **Styled PDF Reports:** Provides professional and detailed reports for clear communication and documentation.
* **Focus on Cardio-Oncology:** Specifically tailored to address the unique challenges of CIC diagnosis.

## Importance for Cardio-Oncologists

Cardio-oncologists specialize in the cardiac side effects of cancer treatments. They rely on accurate and timely diagnostics to prevent and manage cardiovascular complications in cancer survivors and patients undergoing treatment. CardioGuardAI empowers them by:

* **Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy:** Provides AI-driven analysis to supplement clinical expertise.
* **Improving Patient Outcomes:** Enables early detection and intervention to mitigate cardiovascular risks.
* **Streamlining Workflow:** Reduces the time and effort required for manual data analysis and report generation.
